Abstract
========

Our goal is to be able to perform an unbinned analysis using gammapy.
To this end we like to propose to add another data set class that contains
an EventList in addition to the features already implemented for gammapy 
datasets and a different fit statistic.

Motivation
==============

Unbinned data analyses are cool!
